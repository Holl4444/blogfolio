      <p>
        Hey I'm Holly. I transitioned to software engineering from
        music and education. I've always loved creating things, from
        the physical, like pillow forts and makeshift tv antennas to
        the more ephemeral, like music and great experiences for
        pupils. Programming to me is the perfect balance, where I can
        produce something equal parts practical and magical!
      </p>

        Having spent some time living in Sweden I was incredibly
        impressed by the availability of quality education for all and
        I'd love to use coding to contribute towards making knowledge
        free world-wide.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love a challenge and have found plenty both in tackling
        back-end APIs and servers and front-end React states and
        responsive css. I'm drawn to front-end's endless and playful
        possibilities for visuals and interactions and love working
        towards great user experiences. Equally I enjoy tinkering,
        seeing how everything joins together and that dopamine hit
        from cracking a logic conundrum!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've recently graduated from an intensive coding bootcamp and
        am looking for my first professional role in tech.
